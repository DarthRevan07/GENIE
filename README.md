I used the following libraries for a highly efficient and memory-saving representation and computation of jet features (pre-processing) and for the computation of Persistent Homology as a wrapper for the ParticleNet model.

For the computation of Persistent Homology of the jet clouds, I use `Pyrivet` which is a Python API for the RIVET library that allows multiparameter persistence models to be fitted on discrete data, describing it in terms of a continuous shape - an `Abstract Simplicial Complex`.

To initially make single-parameter estimators such as that which has been currently implemented in `1d_persistence.py` I have used the topological methods in `gtda` and also `Ripser` library.


The following figure describes the architecture for the conventional `ParticleNet` model that uses the `EdgeConv` operation on the k-NN graph :

We replace the k-NN graph step by the `Persistence` step. 
The workflow for the project is :
